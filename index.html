    excerpt: "MGCI Robotics welcome all returning and future sponsors to the team! Your support allows us to further STEM education, purchase robots and other equipment, and compete in various robotics competitions. There are many benefits in supporting us. They include branding (on uniforms, robots, and other media), community outreach (primarily in Flemingdon Park and Thorncliffe). You would also be supporting diversity in STEM, as 50% of our members are female or non-binary and over 90% are visible minorities."
