Itâ€™s that time of the year again! MGCI Robotics Club is returning for another year, and the club executives are working hard to make this year a success even with the ongoing pandemic. Applications are open now, and close on 2 October 2021, 23:59.

New* member application: [https://forms.gle/en73prQmS3QvSrsA6](https://discord.gg/BTfXyec)

\* Returning members shoul also fill out the new member application if they are looking to join a team that they were not on last year (outreach, marketing, web, teaching, etc.).

If there are any questions, feel free to ask the executives on the Discord server: [https://discord.gg/BTfXyec](https://discord.gg/BTfXyec)

If there aren't, joining the Discord to discuss robotics and have fun is still a good idea.
